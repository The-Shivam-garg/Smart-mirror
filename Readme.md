# SMART MIRROR 
</div>

## Description:-
   #### A smart mirror, also known as a magic mirror, displays the time, weather, calendar, news, and social media updates. The magic is created by placing a transparent mirror over a screen such as a tablet, monitor, or TV. The technology is driven by a Raspberry Pi or combined Windows PC, with voice recognition and touch technology.

# : Procedure :
## Step:1  Mounting and frame building 

### First things First, we need to make the frame of the smart mirror.

# Step:2 Installation
### We need to install few software‚Äôs and module to obtain the desired result facilities we need as our output in the smart mirror.

<h3 align="left">
So for the software that‚Äôs driving all this. There are two, maybe three ready-to-go solutions for this. The first one, and maybe the most obvious one, is MagicMirror¬≤. That‚Äôs a Raspberry-Pi-native software that‚Äôs made to sit behind a semi-transparent, mirrored piece of glass and shine its information through that mirror, creating that ‚Äúmirror, mirror on the wall‚Äù illusion. MagicMirror¬≤ is free and open-source and has a ton of plugins and expansions. But. First, the interface is optimized to just be black and white, since it‚Äôs made to shine through a mirror, and getting anything to look nice without that mirror is going to take some effort. And, the more severe issue for me, the way you set up MagicMirror¬≤ is by editing JSON files over remote desktop or through an SSH terminal. I don‚Äôt have those sort of masochistic tendencies, so that didn‚Äôt particularly excite me. But I tried anyways, and after digging through the tons of different calendar plugins and finding the one that seems to be the go-to powerful option, I just gave up when I saw the 50-page-long documentation on how to write the JSON that would display a shared calendar. Like, this shouldn‚Äôt be so hard. For me, that‚Äôs not fun to set up, and changing anything in the future would mean re-learning the entire thing again.

It also kind of explains that when MagPi, the official Raspberry Pi Magazine, covered MagicMirror¬≤, they spent five pages explaining how to build the build the wooden frame, and only one page on software. It would probably scare a lot of people away if they covered it more realistically ‚Äì which is the other way around. One page on the frame, five pages on how to edit JSON files.

# Step:3 INTEGRATION
### NOW it‚Äôs the time to integrate all the components, in the previous steps we are done with the frame and software installed raspberry pi. Now we have to integrate the following into the frame: -

<h3 align="left">

>monitor screen <br>
>Two-way mirror <br>
>raspberry pi <br>
>led light <br>

##### The rest work is of connections. Now, Connection needs to be done carefully and the connection should be more Clean and well connected.IF possible try to connect all the systems inside the frame box with the help of multi-socket . so it will seems more clean as after doing so you will have only one wire outside the frame that you want to plug-in in the power supply.

# Step:4 Final Outlook

## <b>Hurray!!!!!!</b>
   ### This is the final outlook of the project.
### In this we will get our reflection with the digital updation of various feature in the mirror itself.
